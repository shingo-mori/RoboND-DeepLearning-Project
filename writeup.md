## Project: Follow Me

#### Steps to complete the project:

- Clone the project repo here
- Fill out the TODO's in the project code as mentioned here
- Optimize your network and hyper-parameters.
- Train your network and achieve an accuracy of 40% (0.4) using the Intersection over Union IoU metric.
- Make a brief writeup report summarizing why you made the choices you did in building the network.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1155/view) Points
### Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup

#### 1. Provide a write-up / README document including all rubric items addressed in a clear and concise manner. The document can be submitted either in either Markdown or a PDF format.

You're reading it!

#### 2. The write-up conveys the an understanding of the network architecture.

#### 3. The write-up conveys the student's understanding of the parameters chosen for the the neural network.

#### 4. The student has a clear understanding and is able to identify the use of various techniques and concepts in network layers indicated by the write-up.

#### 5. The student has a clear understanding of image manipulation in the context of the project indicated by the write-up.

#### 6. The student displays a solid understanding of the limitations to the neural network with the given data chosen for various follow-me scenarios which are conveyed in the write-up.

### Model

#### 1. The model is submitted in the correct format.

#### 2. The neural network must achieve a minimum level of accuracy for the network implemented.
